# Simple-Cache-Simulator
Simple cache simulator written in C.

Program considers:
- Different cache mapping arrangements (direct mapped or fully associative)
- Different cache organisation (unified cache or splitted cache)
- Cache sizes (128-4096B)

Program outputs the statistics (hits, hit rates) using the data from the "mem_trace.txt" file. 

More info in "Description.pdf" file (the description does not match the program fully since I took this course during the previous academic year).

This code was generated for Assignment 2 for Informatics 2C course (Introduction to Computer Systems) at the University of Edinburgh.
